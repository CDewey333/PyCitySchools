Overview
This analysis focused on understanding how a variety of schools compare to one another based on total budget, budget per pupil, and test scores across reading and math. The analysis further segments schools down by size and type (charter or public). The analysis will be presented to the school board for education. A different analysis has a grade from a high school removed due to a suspected fraudulent activity.
Original Data
Average Math Score
•	The average math score at a district level didn’t fluctuate, except one fluctuation in the decimals. The scores of Thomas High School 9th graders were not out of the norm, so removing them from calculation did not improve or worsen the district view.
Average Reading Score
•	Similar to average math scores, the exclusion of Thomas High School 9th graders didn’t significantly change the average scores.
% Passing Math
•	By removing the 9th graders from Thomas High School, the percent passing math dropped by 6-tenths.
% Passing Reading
•	By removing the 9th graders from Thomas High School, the percent passing math dropped by 3-tenths of a point.
% Overall Passing
•	By removing the 9th graders from Thomas High School, the overall percent that passed both Math and Reading were reduced by 8 tenths of a point. In general, the removal of Thomas High School’s suspected fraudulent scores did little to change the analysis at a district level. It also did little to change the Thomas High School Specific Scores (impacting the scores by tenths of a decimal).
Per Student Budget & Spending Ranges
•	Spending per student is largely unchanged, despite removing the scores of Thomas High School students from the analysis. The children are still included in the overall population of the school and consume resources
In Summary
Given that the scores were not outliers, and largely fell within the common ranges little if any impact will be seen at the district analysis. A retake of the exams with updated scores may do more to impact the analysis if the scores change.
